# uk223 Skeleton

homepage: http://localhost:3000
login: http://localhost:3000/login
user component: http://localhost:3000/users

## Usage (Client)

As soon as you're on the website, the first step is the login. You can log in as a user or as an admin. Both users have their own privileges. When logged in, you can read the already posted blogs, or you can create and edit your own.

## Usage (Admin)

The first thing you do as an admin is log in. Then you can edit, create or delete a post that's been created by anyone, even yourself! An admin also has the privilege to manage users. He can delete, edit or add them. 

## Information

The project was written in typescript + react. So if you want to understand the code, you have to be familiar with these languages already. Otherwise you're not going to get it. Frontend was designed and written by Adam Swiderski and Gabriel Arocha. But for it to work correctly, you need the backend. The tests can be found in the cypress folder. To start the code from your own device, type "**yarn start**" in the IDE's console.

## Issues

There are still some issues regarding the user handling. All routes are in the Routes.tsx files.
